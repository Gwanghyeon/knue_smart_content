  'Metaphor is commonly used throughout all types of literature, but it is used most commonly in poetry. In the first two lines of the poem above, the speaker is asking her lover not to leave her “drowning in a sea of grief.”',
  'This expression is an example of metaphor: a way of describing a person or object by referring to something else that has similar characteristics.',
  'How and where does one come across a sea that is filled not with water, but with grief? Furthermore, she is not literally drowning. These lines are meant to convey that the speaker is figuratively being consumed by grief, which makes her feel as if she were drowning.',
  'She feels desperate and hopeless. The metaphor gives the reader a better idea of the depth of the speaker’s grief in this situation.'
